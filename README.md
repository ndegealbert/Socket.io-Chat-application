### Chat-application

A real-time chat application built with React, Node.js, and Socket.io, allowing users in the same group to chat instantly. Using Socket.io for real-time, bi-directional communication, users in a specific group can see and join conversations without page refreshes. React handles the dynamic user interface, while Node.js manages connections, message broadcasting, and room management for a smooth group chat experience.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
